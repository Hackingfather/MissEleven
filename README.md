A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a simple group management bot with multiple admin features, it has evolved into becoming a basis for modular bots aiming to provide simple plugin expansion via a simple drag and drop.

Can be found as [Eleven](https://t.me/MissElevenBot) on Telegram.

Eleven is based on [Hitsuki](https://github.com/HitaloSama/Hitsuki)
